# Project Auth API

In this pair-project I worked with my friend Andreas. The assignment was to create a fullstack project with both an API in the backend and a frontend with a login-form.



## The problem

We approached this task by coading along with some videos and then talked about how to connect the backend. We reused snippets of code from previus projects and also found a nice form that we implemented.
